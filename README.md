# City Explorer Backend (Lab06)

**Author**: Ali Baker Sartawi

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Backend that handles requests to the [City Explorer](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/) website.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

Users will need an `ajax` request to the [City Explorer Backend](https://back-end-301.herokuapp.com/) site, and a matching `mustache` template in their **HTML**. 
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

Built using **JavaScript** and **NODE.JS**.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
